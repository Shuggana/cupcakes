Node.js and Express for web framework

Testing auth0 for externally managed authentication services with some Pug mixins, nothing fancy

Using Pug components for HTML templates. Some CSS.
Pug mixins for authentication buttons to offload authentication services to Auth0

Small but it works.
.env missing from this repo as it contains sensitive data

Going to use this authentication process in a larger application
